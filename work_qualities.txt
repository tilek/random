I created this list to help myself and others find and evaluate people to collaborate with.


1. People's abilities.

1.1. Analytical skills

- Build a good model based on given information
  [Critical thinking and gaining new knowledge are considered to be a part of this.]
- Identify key variables in a situation
  (e.g. what are the key problems in a startup that is not meeting its goals)
  
1.2. Problem solving, ideation, creativity

- Generate candidate actions based on context and goals effectively
  (e.g. coming up with a good business idea, coming up with a good joke [includes problem-solving])
  [If the actions are diverse and surprising it seems to be called creativity.]
- Evaluate candidate actions
  (e.g. estimating whether an idea will be good or a joke will be funny)
