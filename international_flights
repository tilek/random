Here I am writing out notes based on problems I experienced.

1) Before buying a ticket via a transit country, double-check that you are allowed to transit in that country from the immigration point of view.

Here is a situation I experienced in 2016.
Someone I know is a citizen of Kyrgyzstan.
Living in the US she bought a China Southern Airlines ticket to Kyrgyzstan via China.
She could transit on the way from the USA to Kyrgyzstan without problems. She even got out of the city.
One the way back she wasn't let in on the plane.
Apparently, there was a rule that doesn't allow citizens of Kyrgyzstan to transit via China if they are flying from Kyrgyzstan.
Unfortunately, the staff was very rude, in my opinion, and in the end they didn't even refund the ticket.
She had to buy another ticket on another day with a different airline.

2) Before buying a ticket using a credit/debit card for another person be warned that if your transaction will be flagged as suspect the passenger may not be allowed on the flight right at the check-in gate.

If you can't fly with that passenger in person, try to use cash or send money to their bank account, so that they can use their own card.
We had this problem with Turkish Airlines.
