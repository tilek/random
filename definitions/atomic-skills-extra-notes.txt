Bob told Sara that Mary has good communications skills

While sometimes "has good communications skills" I think it's a perfectly good phrase, I believe people use such descriptions way too much.

I believe the problem is that "communication skills" is an enormous set of overlapping skills. This countless list can include skills phrased as:
- explaining your ideas verbally
- explaining your ideas in writing
- storytelling
- negotiation
- presenting to a small audience (tens of people)
- presenting to a large audience (hundreds or thousands of people)
- conflict resolution
- social media communication

The word "good" applies a value judgment. Bob values certain types of communication skills and he thinks generally Mary is good in those dimensions.

I think often the problem is that:
- Saras of the world don't know exactly the skills Bobs value even they know each other for a long time
- Bobs don't evaluate skills properly and use intuition that can often lead to a biased conclusion

Often the result is that Sara generally trusts Bob and ends up thinking Mary is good as some of the communication skills which she isn't good at. If Sara doesn't fully trust Bob she will just have to reevaluate skills herself once again.

To sum, such a generic phrase as "good communication skills" gives very little information with a high probability of creating a false picture for the listener.

And yes, there are cases where you have little time & resources to evaluate skills in more details and "good communication skills" can be better than nothing as it will give a general direction, Sara will just have to be careful about evaluating the skills more deeply.
