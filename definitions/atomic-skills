I believe telling a person that you or someone else has "good communication skills" gives very vague and mixed up information.
I believe it would be more useful to identify "atomic skills" that a person has.

In the ideal definition "atomic skills" are skills that are defined in the following way:
1) Abilities in one skill shouldn't strictly correlate with another skill.

   Example of a strict correlation:
   (a) "John has good communication skills" and (b) "John has great presentation skills". Being good at (a) implies being good at (b).
   Example of a loose correlation:
   (a) "John is good at organizing gatherings" and (b) "John is good at lifting people's moods". There are cases where he could be good at one but not the other.
   Example of no or little correlation:
   (a) "John is good at DJing" and (b) "John is good at understanding Kyrgyz language". He can be extremely good at one and extremely bad at another.

   Example of a strong correlation:
   (a) "John has
