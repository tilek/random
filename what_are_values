What are values?

People are spending their time & energy as well as potentially other resources to obtain something.
For example:
- They are spending time to get sleep.
- They are spending time and energy to hunt fod food.
- They are spending time, energy, and money to get a car.

The main categories that I see now are:
- physical things (water, food, house, car, boat)
- physical states (sleep, sex, comfort, safety, calmness, optimism, confidence)
- patterns of own behavior (self-care, will power, courage)
- patterns of behavior of other people (honesty)

How to identify your own values?

- where you spend your time, energy, money, or other resources.
- people you want to be friends with, people you are inspired by vs people you stop want to be friends with
- debates you have with people
- what produces strong emotions of joy, fear, anger, disgust, etc

Where do values come from?

- common human biology
- unique biology
- conscious and unconsiouse habitual nurture
- impactful life events
