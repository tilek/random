This document is meant to present a framework to evaluate early-stage startups (pre-product market / pre-seed & seed).

I initially came up with this framework in order to evaluate my own startup from the eyes of potential investors. I think it was likely during fundraising of Autumn 2019. It is designed to help me evaluate potential future investments too.

Here are all my early-stage investments, I did not explicitly use this framework for my decision making but I used some of it implicitly:
2020-02-22 Primer (https://primer.com/) / online learning community for children / idea stage
2021-01-08 NBFit (https://nbfit.online/) / online fitness trainings for women / already had technology & users
2021-08-13 Marvin (https://www.meetmarvin.com/) / personalized mental health support for clinicians / already had technology & users

While I am very satisfied with my investments, please judge the outcomes for yourself.

And here is the framework itself:
