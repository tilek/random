# Happiness

- Realize what's under your control and what's not.
  Examples:
  - Can you live forever?
  - Can your parents live forever?
  - Can you prepare for any war or other catastrophe?

- If something is not under your control, find a way to let it go and not worry about it anymore. For example, use humor.

- Spend a lot of time being grateful for what you have or had.

- Spend little time focusing on what you don't have.

- Notice your geniune passions, curiosities, and interests and pursue them often, especially over what seems rational or logical and common advice.

- Notice lots of wonderful, beautiful, thing about life and learn to love it
  Example:
  - Sheer diversity of everything
  - Diversity of biological life
  - Diversity of humans

- Live a lot in the moment instead of ruminating about the past or planning for the possible future too much

- Notice your own anxiety and analyze it rather than simply acting based on it

- Find a good psychotherapist and complete the course
