# Happiness

# Happiness: Strategic

- Realize what's under your control and what's not.
  Examples:
  - Can you live forever?
  - Can your parents live forever?
  - Can you prepare for any war or other catastrophe?

- Learn to go and not worry about what you can't control anymore. For example, use humor.

- Don't expect to always be happy, that's not under your control. Once again, focus on what's under your control, e.g. not eating pizza in the middle of the night.

- Notice your geniune passions, curiosities, and interests and pursue them often, especially over what seems rational or logical and common advice.

- Notice beauty and wonder of eveyday things, learn to love it
  Example:
  - Sheer diversity of everything, living organisms, humans
  - A cup
  - Drinking tea
