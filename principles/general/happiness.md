# Happiness

# Happiness: Strategic

- Realize what's under your control and what's not.
  Examples:
  - Can you live forever?
  - Can your parents live forever?
  - Can you prepare for any war or other catastrophe?

- Learn to go and not worry about what you can't control anymore. For example, use humor.

- Don't expect to always be happy, that's not under your control. Once again, focus on what's under your control, e.g. not eating pizza in the middle of the night.

- Notice your geniune passions, curiosities, and interests and pursue them often, especially over what seems rational or logical and common advice.

- Notice lots of wonderful, beautiful, thing about life and learn to love it
  Example:
  - Sheer diversity of everything
  - Diversity of biological life
  - Diversity of humans
 
# Happiness: Psychotherapy

- Try psychotherapy with several psychotherapists (it could last your whole life with some methodologies such as psychoanalysis)

- Notice your own anxiety and analyze it rather than simply acting based on it

- Realize and notice your main traumas. Process them and heal them.

- Let go of your grievances

- Stop all the negative self-talk or attack yourself in your internal dialogue
  
- Learn to process all emotions in a health way (e.g. cry enough, show anger in a "ecological" way)
