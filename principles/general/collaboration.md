# Collaboration principles

- Be extra careful about leaving the key to the place you are in to another person
  Failure example:
  - 2022-09-15 Staying at Syrga's apartment, leaving for Ololo Creative Economy event at Issyk-Kul lake, was nervous and late for the event

- [IDEA] Before asking someone to help you, make sure it's high on your priority list. Otherwise, following up with them after they help may end up being low on your priority list for a long time.
  
  - <a>Example:</b> ask immigration lawyer to answer questions about travelling a lot before applying for the US citizenship but I am taking weeks to follow up
