# Guide: Finding a psychotherapist

1. Clearly state the goals you have for psychotherapy. 
   Example goals:
   - "Be as healthy and happy as possible"
   - "Get stress & anxiety to a manageable level"
   - "Overcome burnout and prevent future burnouts"
2. Learn the difference between psychologist, psychotherapist, and psychiatrist.
3. Learn about the difference between common types of psychotherapy (e.g. psychoanalysis, Gestalt, CBT).
4. Make a list of people who know you pretty well (e.g. family, relatives, friends, colleagues etc) who seem to be happy and progressing through their lives well.
5. Ask them if they know great psychotherapists that would match you and your goals. Collect their contacts.
6. Mentally prepare yourself to speak to about 10-20 specialists before you find the first right one for you that you can work with long-term (multiple months or years).
7. What to look for to to evaluate a specialist:
   - level of education (great - full medical degree with the focus on psychology, good - psychology degree after 4+ years of university, worrying - several months of courses, very bad and likely illegal - no degree at all)
   - how many years of experience do they have? (ideally, several years of experience; riskier if it's just a few months of therapy)
   - do they go through a supervision (special psychotherapy for psychotherapists)? long how have they been going through it? (very bad if they don't)
   - what topics do they specialize in? (e.g. food intake disorder vs adult children of alcoholics vs LGBT)
   - do they speak the same native language as you? it's extremely helpful if they do
   - how well do they understand your culture (e.g. ethnicity, religion)? it's extremely helpful if they do
   - what obstacles did they have and overcome in their life?
   - do they seem to be living a healthy and happy life?
   - does their office interior look healthy and comfortable?
   - how healthy do they personally look?
   - how well are their clients progressing in their life? (rarely you will know for sure but you get a rough glimpse in some cases)
   - how do their professional and ethical rules compared to other specialists? (more professional ones often have a bit more rules)
   - how much progress do you feel like you are doing compared to other specialists?
   - do you feel like you have a personal connection ("a click") with them?
8. Review relevant specialists on popular platforms and their ratings, if available. 
   Example platforms: 
   in English: BetterHelp 
   in Russian: Yasno.live, Zigmund, Legko.live
9. While having introductory calls please note, it's normal that psychotherapy is often very unpleasant. That's one of the main reasons most people (as of 2025) never started or never continued after the first try.
10. While having introductory calls please note, it's normal that you may not like the specialist from the first try. 
   They can still end up being a great one for you. If you did not like the specialist.
   You can tell them what you did not like and how you feel.
   They can give you useful feedback before you make a decision on someone to work with long-term.
11. Have minimum 5 introductory calls with diverse specialists you got interested in to get a rough sense of the range of specialists.
12. Having more introductory calls until you feel you found the matching one.

Good luck! üôè
