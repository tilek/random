# Guide: Finding a psychologist or psychotherapist

1. Clearly state the goals you have for psychotherapy. 
   Example: "Be as healthy and happy as possible", "Minimize stress & anxiety"
2. Make a list of people who know you pretty well with who seem to be happy and growing and developing well.
3. Ask them if they know great psychotherapists that would match you and your goals, get their contacts, and make a list.
4. Learn the difference between psychologist, psychotherapist, and psychiatrist.
5. Learn about the difference between common types of psychotherapy (e.g. psychoanalysis, Gestalt, CBT).
6. Note, it can help a lot if the specialist speaks your first language and knows your culture deeply.
7. Review relevant specialists on popular platforms. 
   Example platforms: 
   in English: BetterHelp 
   in Russian: Yasno.live, Zigmund, Legko.live
8. Mentally prepare yourself to speak to about 20 specialists before you find the first right one for you that you can work with long-term (multiple months or years).
9. While having introductory calls please note, it's normal that psychotherapy is often very unpleasant. That's one of the main reasons most people (as of 2025) never started or never continued after the first try.
10. While having introductory calls please note, it's normal that you may not like the specialist from the first try. 
   They can still end up being a great one for you. If you did not like the specialist.
   You can tell them what you did not like and how you feel.
   They can give you useful feedback before you make a decision on someone to work with long-term.
11. Have minimum 5 introductory calls with diverse specialists you got interested in to get a rough sense of the range of specialists.
12. Having more introductory calls until you feel you found the matching one.

Good luck! üôè
