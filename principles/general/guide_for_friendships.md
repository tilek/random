# Guide: Good Friendship

In my view, a good friendship when you...

1. Accept
- accept your friend the way they are
- see your friend's strengths
- see your friend's weaknesses and either have endeering feelings about them or just accept them (don't try to change them)
  (exception is when they try to harm themselves, e.g started smoking too much)

2. Trust
- share & protect each other's sensitive private information
- provide important difficult-to-communicate feedback and don't say bad things behind your back

3. Believe
- believe in your friend's boundless potential

4. Spend time
- enjoy spending time with your friend

5. Emotionally interconnect
- care how your friend is doing and ask once in a while, especially when they might be having a difficult time
- feel bad & help when your friend is having a difficult period
- feel good & congratulate when your friend is having a great time

# Guide: Good Close Friendship

I think the main difference between a friendship and a close friendship is the amount of time, attention, emotional & other resources you spend on a friend.
