# Guide: Communicating with someone you got negative emotions towards (anger, annoyance, disappointment, upset, sadness)

1. At any point of the conversation keep your voice calm & at a regular volume.<br>
2. If you are in the same place with the person, if possible, leave to another place as politely as possible.<br>
   Go to a place where you can't see or hear each other.<br>
   If to stay polite it's important to say something before your leave the situation use such words as:<br>
   - "I am sorry but I got angry. I think it's important for me to take a break.".<br>
   - "I am sorry but I am not feeling well right now. I think it's important for me to take a break.".<br>
3. Write down events that happened and your emotions separately from the events.<br>
4. Give yourself enough time to calm down.<br>
   To check if you are calm enough and can write down your thoughts and see if there are negative words popping out.<br>
   If you think your brain might be tired, try to give yourself 8 hours of high-quality night sleep to reset.<br>
5. As soon as possible after that, write out your response:<br>
   (1) What you like about the person and what you appreciate in their impact on you.<br>
   (2) Relevant events as you remember them. Clarify that it's based on your memory and your memory can be faulty.<br>
   (3) How the events made you feel.<br>
   Review it and rewrite it.<br>
6. If possible, agree on a clear time and format to communicate it.<br>
7. Communicate the response based on the written text if possible in real time using the media that provides most information: <br>
   real life > video call > phone call > voice messages > text messages.<br>
