# Guide: Communicating with someone you got negative emotions towards (anger, annoyance, disappointment, upset, sadness)

1. At any point of the conversation keep your voice calm & at a regular volume.<br>

2. If you are in the same place with the person, if possible, leave to another place as politely as possible.<br>
   Go to a place where you can't see or hear each other.<br>
   If to stay polite it's important to say something before your leave the situation use such words as:<br>
   - "I am sorry but I got angry. I think it's important for me to take a break.".<br>
   - "I am sorry but I am not feeling well right now. I think it's important for me to take a break.".<br>

3. Give yourself enough time to calm down.<br>

3.1. Write down events that happened and your emotions separately from the events.<br>
     Feel free to curse and be very emotional, irrational, and untruthful there.<br>
     
3.2. Breathe deeply 5 or more times.<br>

3.3. Figure out your need (e.g. respect for my time).
3.4. Realize that you are angry not on the situation but on what you think about the situation.
     Example: I am not angry because the person was late but I am angry because I feel disrespected.

3.5. Consider doing something physical but useful to physical channel your anger. Consider cursing aloud while noone else hears.
     Example:
     - washing dishes
     - exercises (e.g. jumping jacks might work better than most exercises)
     
4. Write out your response speech.
   (1) What you like about the person and what you appreciate in their impact on you.<br>
   (2) Relevant events as you remember them. Clarify that it's based on your memory and your memory can be faulty.<br>
   (3) How the events made you feel.<br>
   Example:
   "It is very important for me to feel that people respect my time."

41. Review it for extreme negative words or phrases popping out. For anything you may regret saying later.<br>

4.5. If you think your brain might be tired, try to give yourself 8 hours of high-quality night sleep to reset.<br>   

5. If possible, agree on a clear time and format to communicate it.<br>

6. Communicate the response based on the written text if possible in real time using the media that provides most information: <br>
   real life > video call > phone call > voice messages > text messages.<br>
