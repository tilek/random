# Guide: Communicating with someone you got negative emotions towards (anger, annoyance, disappointment, upset, sadness)

1. At any point of the conversation keep your voice calm & at a regular volume.<br>

2. If you are in the same place with the person, if possible, leave to another place as politely as possible.<br>
   Go to a place where you can't see or hear each other.<br>
   If to stay polite it's important to say something before your leave the situation use such words as:<br>
   - "I am sorry but I got angry. I think it's important for me to take a break.".<br>
   - "I am sorry but I am not feeling well right now. I think it's important for me to take a break.".<br>

3. Give yourself enough time to calm down.<br>

3.1. Write down events that happened and your emotions separately from the events.<br>
     Feel free to curse and be very emotional, irrational, and untruthful there.<br>
     
3.2. Breathe deeply 5 or more times.<br>

3.3. Figure out your need (e.g. respect for my time).<br>
3.4. Realize that you are angry not on the situation but on what you think about the situation.<br>
     Example: I am not angry because the person was late but I am angry because I feel disrespected.<br>

3.5. Consider doing something physical but useful to physical channel your anger. Consider cursing aloud while noone else hears.<br>
     Example:<br>
     - washing dishes<br>
     - exercises (e.g. jumping jacks might work better than most exercises)<br>
     
4. Write out your response speech.<br>
   (0) Usual polite introduction. <br>
   (1) Empathize with the person. Where are they? Where is their mind right now? Meet them where they are.<br>
   (2) Remind them where you stand in relation to them in general:<br>
       - That you love them?<br>
       - That you respect them?<br>
       - That you value them a lot in your life?<br>
       - That you feel grateful for their support so far?<br>
       - That you feel grateful for their impact on you?<br>
   (3) If the events weren't recorded digitally (e.g. over email), write out relevant events as you remember them.<br>
       Clarify that it's based on your memory and your memory can be faulty.<br>
   (4) Write out how the events made you feel. Limit strong words to only what's most necessary.<br>
       If you feel the urge to mention many negative words, it might be best to cool down further before writing out a response.<br>
   (5) Write out your psychological need.<br>
       Example: "It is very important for me to feel that people respect my time."
   (6) Write out your polite request.<br>
   (7) Words of gratitude to end off.<br>
   Example:

Hi <FRIEND>,

I hope you are doing well.

Congrats on becoming <NEW ROLE>! I think they are very lucky to have you!

I am sure you know how much love and respect I have for you and I hope you know that I value you a lot in my life. In the interest of developing our relationship further I want to express how I recently felt.

You will be surprised but after seeing your introduction of <FRIENDS FRIEND> I experienced anger. I know you mean well and meant it as a favor for both me and <FRIENDS FRIEND> but regardless of that, I felt disrespect to my time and to me as a person in general.

Whenever someone introduces me to someone, especially if you are the one introducing - a person I respect so deeply - I feel the urge to reply promptly and pay proper attention to the person I was introduced you as I want to make you look good too. And since I already have so much on my plate, nice-to-have introductions like this end up as just more urgent work. And it's the last thing I am looking for right now actually.

Once again, I know you respect me and want only the best for me but I want you to know how I felt. It's important for me to feel that my time is respected and I want to kindly ask you to do double-opt-in introductions. I will be very grateful if you could help me with that and if there is something I can do to improve our relationship on my side, let me know too.

Thank you again for all your support throughout all those years.
I hope for your empathy and understanding once again.
I know you are amazing at that!

With love and respect,
❤️❤️❤️

4.1. Review it for extreme negative words or phrases popping out. For anything you may regret saying later.<br>

5. If you think your brain might be tired, try to give yourself 8 hours of high-quality night sleep to reset.<br>   

6. If possible, agree on a clear time and format to communicate it. Communicate the response based on the written text if possible in real time using the media that provides most information: real life > video call > phone call > voice messages > text messages.<br>
   Remember: all people have some sort of a trauma and are irrational and a bad reply can cost you a long-term relationship if the relationship is fragile.
