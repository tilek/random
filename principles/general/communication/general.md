# General communication principles
- Always stay polite.

- Always only use positive or neutral words. Use negative words only in exceptional situations after a lot of thoughtful consideration or for harmless comedic value.

- If you are sending an important email or email to a large group, make sure you are not too tired (e.g. it's very late) or too emotional.
  - Example misstep: including Outtalent's important financials in an email to a large mailing list that includes an Outtalent competitor.

- If an event that you didn't like happened, understand your impact on the event before assigning causality to another person (blaming).
  Assign causality of negative events to people (blaming) only in exceptional situations after a lot of thoughtful consideration.

- Avoid any words or phrases that can make another person threatened, attacked, or mistrusted. <br>
  If there is a risk of that, make sure to write out what you plan to say and get feedback from someone who is really good at communication.<br>
  It will take more time but it's still better than risking a long-term relationship forever.<br>
