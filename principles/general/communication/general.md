- Only use positive or neutral words. Use negative words only in exceptional situations after a lot of thoughtful consideration.
- If an event that you didn't like happened, understand your impact on the event before assigning causality to another person (blaming).
  Assign causality of negative events to people (blaming) only in exceptional situations after a lot of thoughtful consideration.
