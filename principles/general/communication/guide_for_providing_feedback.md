# Guide: Providing feedback to allies

1. If you are experiencing negative emotions, notice it and manage your reaction.<br>
2. Soon after your felt those emotions, write down what happened.<br>
3. Identify facts ("you sent a message saying XYZ").
4. Separate your feelings and thoughts from facts (e.g. "it made me feel disappointed/angry/attacked/disrespected").<br>
5. Avoid blaming anyone. Avoid using the word "you" whenever possible.<br>
6. Replace blaming phrases like "you abandoned me" with phrases like "after I didn't see a response from you for about 2 days I felt abandoned".<br>
7. Try to avoid negative words unless they describe your emotions (e.g. "I felt disappointed/angry/attacked/disrespected").<br>
8. Be careful about using negative analogies that may be too strong (e.g. "I felt like a slave"). They can be remembered for many years and keep generating negativity. It may make sense to use them only after a lot of thoughtful consideration.<br>

Note:
This format is partly inspired by the idea of nonviolent [communication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonviolent_Communication).
[Marshall Rosenberg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marshall_Rosenberg) is one of the people who popularized this idea.<br>
