# Guide: Providing feedback to allies

1. If you are experiencing negative emotions, notice it and manage your reaction.<br>
2. Soon after your felt those emotions, write down what happened.<br>
3. Avoid sending emails!<br>
4. Identify facts ("you sent a message saying XYZ").
5. Separate your feelings and thoughts from facts (e.g. "it made me feel disappointed/angry/attacked/disrespected").<br>
6. Avoid blaming anyone. Avoid using the word "you" whenever possible.<br>
7. Replace blaming phrases like "you abandoned me" with phrases like "after I didn't see a response from you for about 2 days I felt abandoned".<br>
8. Try to avoid negative words unless they describe your emotions (e.g. "I felt disappointed/angry/attacked/disrespected").<br>
9. Be careful about using negative analogies that may be too strong (e.g. "I felt like a slave"). They can be remembered for many years and keep generating negativity. It may make sense to use them only after a lot of thoughtful consideration.<br>
