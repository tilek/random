# Guide: Providing feedback to allies

Try not to react in real-time. <br>
Ideally, soon after your felt those emotions, write down what happened.<br>
Identify facts ("you sent a message saying XYZ").<br>
Separate your feelings and thoughts from facts (e.g. "it made me feel disappointed/angry/attacked/disrespected").<br>
Avoid blaming anyone. Avoid using the word "you" unless you talk about facts.<br>
Replace blaming phrases like "you abandoned me" with phrases like "after I didn't see a response from you for about 2 days I felt abandoned".<br>
Try to avoid negative words unless they described your emotions.<br>
Be careful about using negative analogies that may be too strong (e.g. "I felt like a slave"). They can be remembered for many years and keep generating negativity.<br>

Note: This format is partly inspired by the idea of ["nonviolent communication"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonviolent_Communication). [Marshall Rosenberg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marshall_Rosenberg) is one of the people who popularized this idea.<br>
