# Sharing feedback about people with them or others
- Only give positive (e.g. 'kind') or neutral (e.g. 'engineer') labels to people, never give negative labels

- Publicly only talk positively or neutrally about people, even if you think they are unethical
  
  - Misstep example: Writing and publishing an Instagram post about a woman from Kyrgyzstan that claimed to have worked at Google.
    It attracted a lot of negativity. A lot of people on the Internet didn't go into details.
    It challenged my relationship with several people I like and respect.
    
- If you experienced negative emotions or thoughts towards a person or their impact, provide feedback in an organized thoughtful way

  Try not to react in real-time. Ideally, soon after your felt those emotions, write down what happened.
  Identify facts ("you sent a message saying XYZ") and separate your feelings and thoughts from them (e.g. "it made me feel disappointed/angry/attacked/disrespected").
  Avoid blaming anyone. Avoid using the word "you" unless you talk about facts.
  Replace blaming phrases like "you abandoned me" with phrases like "after I didn't see a response from you for about 2 days I felt abandoned".
  Try to avoid negative words unless they described your emotions.
  Be careful about using negative analogies that may be too strong (e.g. "I felt like a slave"). They can be remembered for many years and keep generating negativity.
         
  This format is partly inspired by the idea of "nonviolent communication". You can read more about it online.
     
  Once you are ready to provide thoughtful feedback, provide it using a channel recommended by Outtalent:
  - If it's a feedback from a fellow to Outtalent team, please use a form provided.
  - Otherwise, please aim to provide feedback directly to the person who you think caused the issue.
  - If that's too hard, reach out to Outtalent team member to ask for the best way to communicate feedback.

- Avoid saying negative things about allies behind their back.
  Instead write the feedback down. Organize in a thoughtful way.
