# Sharing feedback about people with them or others
- Only give positive (e.g. 'kind') or neutral (e.g. 'engineer') labels to people, never give negative labels

- Publicly only talk positively or neutrally about people, even if you think they are unethical

  - Misstep example: <br>
    Writing and publishing an Instagram post about a woman from Kyrgyzstan that claimed to have worked at Google.<br>
    It attracted a lot of negativity. A lot of people on the Internet didn't go into details.<br>
    It challenged my relationship with several people I like and respect.<br>
    
- If you experienced negative emotions or thoughts towards an ally or their impact, write it out and provide feedback in an organized thoughtful way. Never say negative things behind their back. See: [Guide for providing feedback to allies](https://github.com/tilek/random/blob/master/principles/general/communication/guide_for_providing_feedback.md).
