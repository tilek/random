# Sharing feedback about people with them or others
- Only give positive (e.g. 'kind') or neutral (e.g. 'engineer') labels to people

- Publicly only talk positively or neutrally about people, even if you think their ethics is too different from yours

  - Misstep example: <br>
    Writing and publishing an Instagram post about a woman from Kyrgyzstan that claimed to have worked at Google.<br>
    It attracted a lot of negativity. A lot of people on the Internet didn't go into details.<br>
    It challenged my relationship with several people I like and respect.<br>
    
- If you experienced negative emotions or thoughts towards an ally, provide feedback in an organized thoughtful way. See: [Guide for providing feedback to allies](https://github.com/tilek/random/blob/master/principles/general/communication/guide_for_providing_feedback.md). Never say negative things behind their back.

- If you are experiencing anger, please see [Guide for communicating while angry](https://github.com/tilek/random/blob/master/principles/general/communication/guide_for_communicating_while_angry.md)
