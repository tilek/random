# Sharing feedback about people with them or others
- Only give positive (e.g. 'kind') or neutral (e.g. 'engineer') labels to people, never give negative labels

- Publicly only talk positively or neutrally about people, even if you think they are unethical

  - Misstep example: <br>
    Writing and publishing an Instagram post about a woman from Kyrgyzstan that claimed to have worked at Google.<br>
    It attracted a lot of negativity. A lot of people on the Internet didn't go into details.<br>
    It challenged my relationship with several people I like and respect.<br>
    
- If you experienced negative emotions or thoughts towards a person or their impact, provide feedback in an organized thoughtful way

  Try not to react in real-time. Ideally, soon after your felt those emotions, write down what happened.<br>
  Identify facts ("you sent a message saying XYZ").<br>
  Separate your feelings and thoughts from facts (e.g. "it made me feel disappointed/angry/attacked/disrespected").<br>
  Avoid blaming anyone. Avoid using the word "you" unless you talk about facts.<br>
  Replace blaming phrases like "you abandoned me" with phrases like "after I didn't see a response from you for about 2 days I felt abandoned".<br>
  Try to avoid negative words unless they described your emotions.<br>
  Be careful about using negative analogies that may be too strong (e.g. "I felt like a slave"). They can be remembered for many years and keep generating negativity.<br>

  This format is partly inspired by the idea of "nonviolent communication". You can read more about it online.<br>

- Avoid saying negative things about allies behind their back.
  Instead write the feedback down. Organize in a thoughtful way.<br>
