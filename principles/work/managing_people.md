# Managing people

- If I am acting in a role of a manager or educational batch manager and someone performs below the agreed bar, do not come up with a sanction on the spot and announce it.
  Only announce that you want to talk 1-1 after the meeting. Then, have a 1-1 chat right after, explain what you saw, show how you think such performance maps to reward-sanction agreements, and only after some feedback execute the pre-agreed rules. If needed, you can communicate about the decided sanctions to needed people after the emotions of the situation settle.<br>

- If it's unclear what a person is spending time on, don't ask them directly in front of others.
  It could be perceived as a critique. Have a 1-1 conversation to understand their time allocation.
