# Managing people

- If I am acting in a role of a manager or educational batch manager and someone performs below the agreed bar, do not come up with a sanction on the spot and announce it, only announce that you want to talk 1-1 after the meeting. Then, have a 1-1 chat right after,<br>
   explain what you saw, show how you think such performance maps to reward-sanction agreements, and only after some feedback execute<br>
   the pre-agreed rules. If needed, you can communicate about the decided sanctions to needed people after the emotions of the <br>
   situation settle.<br>
