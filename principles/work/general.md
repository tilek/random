# General work principles

1) Always have a contract above certain amount of spend;
1a) When you start working with people remind them that you can make a mistake verbally and should should only trust written agreement for important things.

Failure stories:
- Zeta.Create was supposed to make a video for us but was pushing the recording dates
- A lot of vendors don't do things on time, do things of low quality, hard to reach during the process, hard to reach after they finish work, don't offer guarantee, rude or impolite (using formal language as if you are a student), unsafe (e.g. drivers driving too fast while you are in car)
- Sometimes you informally agree on a certain compensation and either things change in your business or you made a mistake and you will either have to follow up your agreement strictly or change the pricing (examples: Ana G, Anna Z)
