# Running a company

- Before a person starts collaborating, identify potential competition and agree on communications.
  Have a written non-compete agreement where possible, if too hard or unnecessary, then have a written agreement that the person will<br>
  notify if the chance of a potential competition significantly changed (e.g. by ~5%) or it hit a certain threshold (e.g. 10%).<br>

- Once you reach an agreement to collaborate with a person, clearly identify for yourself their trust and access level.
  For example:<br>
  - Company partners (need-based access only)<br>
  - Extended community / company's friends (sharing monthly updates, accomplishments)<br>
  - Private community (access to "public" channels in a private online group communication, need-based documentation read access)<br>
  - Core community (access to special news, need-based edit document/data access)<br>
  - Team (need-based password access, team folders with documents)<br>
  - Core team (passwords to all main team's online accounts, people's salaries, read company finances, need-based ability to pay)<br>
  - CEO (ability to approve company contracts)<br>
