RUNNING A COMPANY
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
x. Before a person starts collaborating, identify potential competition and agree on communications.
- Have a written non-compete agreement where possible, if too hard or unnecessary, then have a written agreement that the person will
  notify if the chance of a potential competition significantly changed (e.g. by ~5%) or it hit a certain threshold (e.g. 10%).
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
x. Once you reach an agreement to collaborate with a person, clearly identify for yourself their trust and access level.
For example:
- Company partners (need-based access only)
- Extended community / company's friends (sharing monthly updates, accomplishments)
- Private community (access to "public" channels in a private online group communication, need-based documentation read access)
- Core community (access to special news, need-based edit document/data access)
- Team (need-based password access, team folders with documents)
- Core team (passwords to all main team's online accounts, people's salaries, read company finances, need-based ability to pay)
- CEO (ability to approve company contracts)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
x. If I am acting in a role of a manager or educational batch manager and someone performs below the agreed bar, do not come up with a sanction on the spot and announce it, only announce that you want to talk 1-1 after the meeting. Then, have a 1-1 chat right after, explain what you saw, show how you think such performance maps to reward-sanction agreements, and only after some feedback execute the pre-agreed rules. If needed, you can communicate about the decided sanctions to needed people after the emotions of the situation settle.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
x. Right before raising your seed round, learn the key financial and business terms.
Examples:
- gross margin
- churn rate
- net revenue (gross revenue minus costs directly related to revenue)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
x. If investor pitch is coming up, learn the key information about the investor:
- Key team members & their high-level career history
- Key marketing claims on their website
- Who they invested in: famous companies (and which investment stage), companies in your space
- Learn about key companies they invested in in the space as investors are likely to compare your company to them.
  Their potential negative experience is likely to significantly bias them.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
x. If I am sending an important email or email to a large group, make sure I am not too tired (e.g. it's very late) or too emotional.
Example mistakes: including Outtalent's important financials in an email to a large mailing list that includes an Outtalent competitor.
