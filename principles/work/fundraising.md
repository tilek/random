# Before the round starts

- Right before raising your round, learn the key financial and business terms.<br><br>
  Examples: <br>
  - gross margin <br>
  - churn rate <br>
  - net revenue (gross revenue minus costs directly related to revenue) <br>

# Before communicating with a specific investor

- Never put them on a pedestal.<br><br>
  For example, don't offer to come far away to meet them.<br>
  Otherwise, you will likely appear needy. It will display low self-esteem. Self-esteem should be extremely high instead.<br>
  Failure example: trying to schedule a pitch with Murat in 2025<br>

# Before a specific investor pitch

- If investor pitch is coming up, learn the key information about the investor:<br><br>
  - Key team members & their high-level career history <br>
  - Key marketing claims on their website <br>
  - Who they invested in: famous companies (and which investment stage), companies in your space <br>
  - Learn about key companies they invested in in the space as investors are likely to compare your company to them. <br>
    Their potential negative experience is likely to significantly bias them. <br>
