- Right before raising your round, learn the key financial and business terms.
  Examples: <br>

- If investor pitch is coming up, learn the key information about the investor:
  - Key team members & their high-level career history <br>
  - Key marketing claims on their website <br>
  - Who they invested in: famous companies (and which investment stage), companies in your space <br>
  - Learn about key companies they invested in in the space as investors are likely to compare your company to them. <br>
    Their potential negative experience is likely to significantly bias them. <br>
