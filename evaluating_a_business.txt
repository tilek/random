Here is a framework I came up with to help myself evaluate early-stage startups (pre-product market / pre-seed & seed).
It helped me evaluate my own startup from the eyes of potential great investors too.

All my early-stage investments:
2020-02-22 Primer (https://primer.com/) / online learning community for children / idea stage
2021-01-08 NBFit (https://nbfit.online/) / online fitness trainings for women / already had technology & users
2021-08-13 Marvin (https://www.meetmarvin.com/) / personalized mental health support for clinicians / already had technology & users

While I am very satisfied with my investments, please judge the outcomes for yourself whether they are a success in your eyes.

The framework:

1. Individual founders
