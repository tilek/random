If you are choosing an educational institution in order to get a job, then I recommend you the following.

1. Sources of information

1.1. Company website
1.1.1. Be careful about testimonials published on company's website
1.1.1.1. You can doublecheck if the photos of people are real by giving the images to a search engine like Google and seeing if the photo comes up on many other random websites and seems like a stock photo.
1.1.1.2. If they provide graduates full names and you can find graduates on LinkedIn, then the testimonials are more likely to be truthful.
1.1.1.3. If it's unclear who wrote the testimonials (a real graduate or someone else), it's a red flag.

1.2. User review websites (e.g. trustpilot.com, coursereport.com)
1.3. LinkedIn (for finding and connecting to graduates, learning where they worked before and after the study, etc)
1.4. Salary information websites (e.g. levels.fyi, glassdoor.com, teamblind.com)
1.4. Other websites
     Use the best search engines available on the market to make a shortlist of the best educational institutions
     I believe usually Google is the best search engine.
     If you are in one of those countries, you can try a local search engine in addition or instead:
     Yandex (Russia), Naver (South Korea), Seznam (Czech Republic).
     
2. Information to focus on

2.1. Basics about the course - price, prerequisites, content, goals, length [company website]
2.2. What % of students successfully graduate in time? [company website or in private from graduates]

2.4. What companies & roles do they get? [company website, LinkedIn or in private from graduates]
2.5. What salaries approximately do they get? [salary information websites]
2.6. What do graduates think about their experience? [in private from graduates]
2.7.1. Do they think it was worth it?
