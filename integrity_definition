1. My personal definition of integrity
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1.1. Personal internal integrity

- You accept the truth about yourself the way it is
- You accept the truth about the reality the way it is

1.2. Personal external integrity

- You present only truthful information, exception situations that fall under designed exceptions (see. 1.2.1)
- You put an effort to act and speak in a way that makes sure your allies have a truthful picture of what you think about them

  1.2.1. Agreed exceptions to external integrity

  - When you am forced to deal with someone who
    - is irrational (believes in incorrect information, thinks irrationally, and acts irrationally)
    - is likely to harm you in a way you wouldn't harm them

  Extreme examples:
  - you are Jewish in Nazi Germany 
  - you are atheist in Afghanistan, Iran, Malaysia, Maldives, Mauritania, Nigeria, Pakistan, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Somalia, Libya, the UAE, Yemen
