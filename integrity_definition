My personal definition of integrity

1. Personal internal integrity

- You accept the truth about yourself the way it is
- You accept the truth about the reality the way it is
- Writing out values & principles and acting accordingly, updating them when needed

2. Personal external integrity

- You make it clear to yourself who your allies are
- Your collaborators know that they are your allies and collaborators
- You make it clear what information
  - must remain private
  - can only be shared with allies
- You present only truthful information except when significantly irrational people can significantly harm you
- You act and speak in a way that helps your allies have a correct picture of what you think about them

Agreed exceptions to external integrity

- When I am forced to deal with someone who
  - irrational (believes in incorrect information, thinks irrationally, and acts irrationally)
  - is likely to harm me in a way you wouldn't harm them

Extreme examples:
- I am Jewish in Nazi Germany 
- I am atheist in Afghanistan, Iran, Malaysia, Maldives, Mauritania, Nigeria, Pakistan, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Somalia, Libya, the UAE, Yemen
- I am gay in Afghanistan, Brunei, Iran, Mauritania, Nigeria, Pakistan, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Somalia, Sudan, the UEA, Yemen

3. Organizational integrity

- All information is recorded correctly 
- All communicated information paints a precise picture of the reality

4. Exceptional organization integrity

- All information is well organized
