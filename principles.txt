DRAFT

Inspired by Ray Dalio I will experiment by writing down principles I used for decision making.

Sections:

1. Work
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1.1. Universal work principles
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1.1.x. A company contractor is asking to share company's information outside the scope of their work.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1.2. Running a company
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1.2.x. Before a person starts collaborating, identify potential competition and agree on communications.
- Have a written non-compete agreement where possible, if too hard or unnecessary, then have a written agreement that the person will
  notify if the chance of a potential competition significantly changed (e.g. by ~5%) or it hit a certain threshold (e.g. 10%).
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1.2.x. Once you reach an agreement to collaborate with a person, clearly identify for yourself their trust and access level.
For example:
- Company partners (need-based access only)
- Extended community / company's friends (sharing monthly updates, accomplishments)
- Private community (access to "public" channels in a private online group communication, need-based documentation read access)
- Core community (access to special news, need-based edit document/data access)
- Team (need-based password access, team folders with documents)
- Core team (passwords to all main team's online accounts, people's salaries, read company finances, need-based ability to pay)
- CEO (ability to approve company contracts)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1.2.x. If I am acting in a role of a manager or educational batch manager and someone performs below the agreed bar, do not come up with a sanction on the spot and announce it, only announce that you want to talk 1-1 after the meeting. Then, have a 1-1 chat right after, explain what you saw, show how you think such performance maps to reward-sanction agreements, and only after some feedback execute the pre-agreed rules. If needed, you can communicate about the decided sanctions to needed people after the emotions of the situation settle.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1.2.x. Right before raising your seed round, learn the key financial and business terms.
Examples:
- gross margin
- churn rate
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1.2.x. If investor pitch is coming up, learn the key information about the investor:
- Key team members & their high-level career history
- Key marketing claims on their website
- Who they invested in: famous companies (and which investment stage), companies in your space
- Learn about key companies they invested in in the space as investors are likely to compare your company to them.
  Their potential negative experience is likely to significantly bias them.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2. Personal life
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2.1. Brain management
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2.1. Conduct X minutes of meditation every Y days.
Examples of why it's important:
- You avoid saying something under negative emotions that can hurt myself in the long-term and can unnecessarily hurt others too.
- You avoid getting into painful states of stress.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2.2. Communication
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2.1.x. If you feel negative emotions from an event and you think someone you are communicating to did something "bad", hold off your response for as long as possible but not longer than 24 hours. You can let them know you are experiencing negative emotions and want to respond calmly in the next 24 hours. Do not raise your voice, do not blame them, use any negative words etc. Write down events as you see them for now, write down your emotions. Write out a response after 24 hours. Review it. Communicate the response based on the written text in real time if possible using the media than provides most information (real life > video call > phone call > voice messages > text messages).
