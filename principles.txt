DRAFT

Inspired by Ray Dalio I will experiment by writing down principles I used or want to use for decision making.

Sections:

1. Work
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1.1. Universal work principles
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1.2. Running a company
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1.2.x. Before a person starts collaborating, identify potential competition and agree on communications.
- Have a written non-compete agreement where possible, if too hard or unnecessary, then have a written agreement that the person will
  notify if the chance of a potential competition significantly changed (e.g. by ~5%) or it hit a certain threshold (e.g. 10%).
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1.2.x. Once you reach an agreement to collaborate with a person, clearly identify for yourself their trust and access level.
For example:
- Company partners (need-based access only)
- Extended community / company's friends (sharing monthly updates, accomplishments)
- Private community (access to "public" channels in a private online group communication, need-based documentation read access)
- Core community (access to special news, need-based edit document/data access)
- Team (need-based password access, team folders with documents)
- Core team (passwords to all main team's online accounts, people's salaries, read company finances, need-based ability to pay)
- CEO (ability to approve company contracts)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1.2.x. If I am acting in a role of a manager or educational batch manager and someone performs below the agreed bar, do not come up with a sanction on the spot and announce it, only announce that you want to talk 1-1 after the meeting. Then, have a 1-1 chat right after, explain what you saw, show how you think such performance maps to reward-sanction agreements, and only after some feedback execute the pre-agreed rules. If needed, you can communicate about the decided sanctions to needed people after the emotions of the situation settle.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1.2.x. Right before raising your seed round, learn the key financial and business terms.
Examples:
- gross margin
- churn rate
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1.2.x. If investor pitch is coming up, learn the key information about the investor:
- Key team members & their high-level career history
- Key marketing claims on their website
- Who they invested in: famous companies (and which investment stage), companies in your space
- Learn about key companies they invested in in the space as investors are likely to compare your company to them.
  Their potential negative experience is likely to significantly bias them.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2. Personal life
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2.1. Brain management
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2.1. Conduct X minutes of meditation every Y days.
Examples of why it's important:
- You avoid saying something under negative emotions that can hurt myself in the long-term and can unnecessarily hurt others too.
- You avoid getting into painful states of stress.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2.2. Communication
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2.2.1. Communication principles for all situations.
2.2.1.x. Always stay polite.
2.2.1.x. Only use positive or neutral words. Use negative words only after a lot of thoughtful consideration.
2.2.1.x. Take ownership of events, blame someone only after a lot of thoughtful consideration.
2.2.1.x. Only give positive (e.g. 'kind') or neutral (e.g. 'engineer') labels to people, never give negative labels

2.2.1. Communication when you get angry in relation to someone's behavior.

Step 0. At any point while angry, keep your voice calm & at a normal volume.
Step 1. If you are in the same place with the person, if possible, leave to another place as politely as possible.
        Go to a place where you can't see or hear each other.
        If to stay polite it's important to say something before your leave the situation use such words as:
        - "I am sorry but I got angry. I think it's important for me to take a break.".
        - "I am sorry but I am not feeling well right now. I think it's important for me to take a break.".
Step 2. Write down events that happened and your emotions separately from the events.
Step 3. Give yourself enough time to calm down.
        To check if you are calm enough and can write down your thoughts and see if there are negative words popping out.
        If you think your brain might be tired, try to give yourself 8 hours of high-quality night sleep to reset.
Step 3. As soon as possible after that, write out your response:
        (1) What you like about the person and what you appreciate in their impact on you.
        (2) Relevant events as you remember them. Clarify that it's based on your memory and your memory can be faulty.
        (3) How the events made you feel.
        Review it and rewrite it.
Step 4. If possible, agree on a clear time and format to communicate it.
Step 5. Communicate the response based on the written text if possible in real time using the media that provides most information: 
        real life > video call > phone call > voice messages > text messages.
        
Failures:
- Meder 2021 (around March) - support
- Henrique 2022 (around February) - feedback, anger, politeness, negative stereotypes
- Bojan 2022 (around February) - feedback, anger, politeness
- Nazerke 2022 (around February) - ideas, competition
Successes:
- Maksim 2022 (around January) - feedback
- 2022-02-16 A girl named Rafael at the Selina coworking space (I thought her voice was too loud)

2.3. Collaboration
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2.3.1. Before asking someone to help you, make sure it's high on your priority list. Otherwise, following up with them after they help may end up being low on your priority list for a long time.

Examples:
- ask immigration lawyer to answer questions about travelling a lot before applying for the US citizenship but I am taking weeks to follow up
